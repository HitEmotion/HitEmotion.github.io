# Unveiling the Cognitive Compass: Theory-of-Mind–Guided Multimodal Emotion Reasoning

---

## Overview

In summary, this work makes three key contributions:

> **(1) HitEmotion Benchmark.**  
> We introduce **HitEmotion**, a **Theory-of-Mind (ToM)-grounded hierarchical benchmark** for multimodal emotion understanding, diagnosing capability breakpoints across increasing cognitive depths (from perception/recognition to cognition/reasoning).

> **(2) ToM-guided Reasoning Chain.**  
> We propose a **ToM-guided reasoning chain** that explicitly tracks intermediate mental states (e.g., beliefs/intentions) and calibrates cross-modal evidence for more faithful emotional reasoning.

> **(3) TMPO Optimization.**  
> We further introduce **TMPO**, a reinforcement learning method that uses **intermediate mental states as process-level supervision** (signals + rewards) to strengthen and stabilize reasoning, improving both accuracy and faithfulness.
